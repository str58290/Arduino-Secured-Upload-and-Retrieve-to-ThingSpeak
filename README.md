# Arduino HTTPS uploading and retrieving of data from ThingSpeak. #

## Context: ##
This project was created to help users securely (using HTTPS) POST and GET to/from their ThingSpeak field. 
In my context, it was field 2 of my ThingSpeak channel that I had wanted to POST and GET from.

## Arduino_Secured_Upload_Retrieve_ThingSpeak2.ino ##
This code essentially POST/uploads a random test data (in this case an integer '0') to field 2, and after waiting for 20s, GET/retrieve the random test data from field 2 for viewing.

See Arduino_Secured_Upload_Retrieve_ThingSpeak2.ino attached and apply as needed.
