# Arduino HTTPS uploading and retrieving of data from ThingSpeak. #

## Context: ##
This project was created to help users securely (using HTTPS) POST and GET to/from their ThingSpeak field. 
In my context, it was field 2 of my ThingSpeak channel that I had wanted to POST and GET from.

See Arduino_Secured_Upload_Retrieve_ThingSpeak.ino attached and apply as needed.
